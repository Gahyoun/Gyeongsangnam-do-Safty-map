# Gyeongsangnam-do Safety Map

Agent-based patrol simulation and safety heatmaps for all 18 municipalities
in Gyeongsangnam-do, Korea. This repository implements the workflow used in
the “융·복합 ICT 활용 공모전 2025” by the **데이터에 물리다 (Data in Physics)** team.

  - Per-city statistics of simulated patrol coverage.

Subregion exports:

- `Subregion html/` – per-city interactive HTML maps.
- `Subregion pdf/` – per-city high-resolution PDF maps.
- `Subregion png/` – per-city PNG snapshots.

> **Note on large files**  
> High-resolution PNG/PDF/HTML outputs and all per-city exports are too large
> to store directly on GitHub. They are hosted on Google Drive instead:

## Method overview (step-by-step)

1. **Data preparation**
   - Import census population, area statistics, school locations, and CCTV
     camera positions for all 18 municipalities in Gyeongsangnam-do.
   - Download and preprocess OpenStreetMap road networks.

2. **Route design (Step 2 in the proposal)**
   - Build base road graphs and extract feasible patrol loops for each
     police station.
   - Visualization of this step is available as a video:

3. **Agent-based patrol simulation (Step 3)**
   - Convert road graphs into junction graphs and 10 m edge segments.
   - Simulate 3-hour patrols with stochastic side-detours (probability of
     entering and returning).
   - Aggregate visit counts per edge and discretize them into 5 safety
     levels using quantiles.

4. **Province-wide aggregation**
   - Independently simulate each municipality and then merge all 18
     results into a single Gyeongsangnam-do safety layer.
   - Export:
     - High-resolution PNG/PDF maps with satellite basemaps.
     - Interactive Folium HTML map for web viewing.
     - CSV summaries by municipality.
